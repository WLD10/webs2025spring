                <p><strong>Main Focus: Forming Intricate Structures using Folding, Utilizing Available Space and Maxizing Accessibility</strong></p>
                <p> This class, taught by Nickie Cheung and Marvin Toure, was a step in or design process to expand our thinking outside of usual boxes.
                    By forcing us into folding, there truly was no precise and thought out folds that could create something preplanned.
                    Our intro to folding began with a 1-year exhibit that would take place of the previously empty site, then being replaced by our designed 10-year projects.
                    Our class was split into two different groups, one of which would focus on designing a dance studio combo building, while the other focused on a library - coffee shop combo building.
                    I felt that the library option allowed for a more common flow of interest, leading to my final structure.

                <p>After contructing the physical model, we then had to create and mirror our design into a digital structure, allowing for them to be printed and scaled.
                    The struggle of the project came when I had to depict the slopes of the walls, as they were not designed to be 90 degrees vertical.
                    This meant that all of my flor plans would show a small slope of the wall as the cuts are typically taken from three to four feet above the floor level.
                    Once the main model of my building was measured and implemented, adding the details was one of the most humbling parts, as it allows the viewer to visualize scaling with human-like figures and desks.
