                <p><strong>Main Focus: Developing Intricate Design Aspects using Verbage and Interaction</strong></p>
                <p> This class, taught by Jose Pertierra-Arrojo, introduced us into using precedents and analysing their strengths, later adapting them into our own structures.
                    My main predecent was the Horizontal Skyscraper, designed by Steven Holl Architects, created a city in the sky, allowing for the underside to be utilized as a natural greenspace.
                    I further developed this idea into my museum, elevating it a story above the ground below, allowing for bike trails and walkways to be accessed.
                    My City of Bridges Museum stemmed out in various directions, aiming to showcase historical bridges and their influence on existing neighborhoods.

                <p>With the main model constructed, this class was our first attempt at realistically rendered site plans and sections.
                    The site plan highlights various pathways that intersect to create small gathering spaces and activity points for visitors, increasing the sense of interactivity within the site.
                    The sections were used to focus on how users would interact inside of the museum, whether they were walking between exhibits or experiencing the one they occupied.
