                <p><strong>Main Focus: Construction Materials and their Real Dimensions</strong></p>
                <p> This class, guided by Jozef Petrak, was the closest we have experienced to real architecture documents and work.
                    The two design groups for our site in Regent Square were either a bike shop or a community meeting space, and I felt as though a community space would be more beneficial for a location with such a rich history.
                    Taking site elements into account such as Frick Park and the Clay Tennis Courts nearby, I knew this would be a very active and populated area.
                    The central plaza allows for any interaction, while meetings and special events can be held within the space, adding a sense of privacy depending on the matter.

                <p>The documents had been the most engaging part of the project, as it added the most impact and realism to our submission.
                    By taking correct wall thickness and materials into account, rooms had to be adjusted and designed to work with those dimensions, making it one big puzzle.
                    The exterior of the building was also an interesting aspect to play with, as I utilized two different types of rainscreens, paying homage to the mix of natural and developed components surrounding the site.
