                <p><strong>Main Focus: Utilizing and Implementing Environmental Aspects of the Site and Location</strong></p>
                <p> This class, guided by Christopher Guignon, started to introduce the more real-life details of architecture, such as the weather and population.
                    Our designs had to nteract with the enivornment and the community in different ways, making all of the projects vastly different.
                    With my partner Brandon Hines, we created our Oakland community housing project with a focus on natural ventilation and rainwater usage.
                    The tunnels and underpasses created using smaller pathways allow for wind to travel through the structure, rather than around it like a usual complex.
                    Our community space, decorated with string lights and seating, seeks to increase activity and safety, especially in a community full of nightlife.

                <p>Tools Used: AutoCAD, Illustrator, InDesign, & SketchUp</p>
                <p>With the physical model containing many smaller intricate parts, the digital model had tons of room for detail.
                    We depicted various wooden slats on the side of the building, creating a supposed texture and natural feel to the building.
                    The renders are a way to visualize how the space may look when fully decorated, especially when scale is affecting the user.
                    The overall concept translated nicely into our digital components, allowing the process of constructing supporting diagrams to become a lot easier.
