                <p><strong>Main Focus: Develop Ideas of Public and Private Moments and Viewpoints</strong></p>
                <p> This class, taught by Nickie Cheung and Alaina Klein, was our first college Architecture course, allowing for slow and steady improvements in the basics.
                    Our focus on the larger picture and creating different feelings throughout the site using lighting, proposed nature, and hardscapes allowed for the smaller details to shine through.
                    With an emphasis on the public and private aspects of structures, we were tasked with designing two buildings from a single form, one with a private feel, while the other provided a clear public feel.

                <p>Both forms began with a simple box, going through at least six different transformations, involving sliding, rotating, removing, and replacing pieces.
                    Once the boxes were completely changed, smaller details such as stairs and ladders were implemented to make the boxes usable and habitable to visitors of the site.
                    Other site elements such as a central reflecting pool and the boat dock add locations for visitors to travel to, creating a natural sense of destination.
