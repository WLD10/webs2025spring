Your final project files (html, css, images, etc) should go in this folder. **One of those files should be called index.html**: it will become your landing page. Otherwise, your site will land on this readme; probably not what you intended!

You can then publish this site to the open web: First, go to your repository's Settings and select "Pages" in the margin.

Then change the source from "none" to the "main" branch, and change the folder from "root" to "docs".

This is a default configuration; note that you could choose other branches, or other folders. But main > docs should work for now!

Your default URL, for a repository located at https://github.com/_username_/_reponame_, will then be https://_username_.github.io/_reponame_. (See how our course website uses the same structure?) Note that if you put index.html in a subfolder rather than directly in docs, you'll need to add to that default URL to find your real homepage: https://_username_.github.io/_reponame_/_subfoldername_.

# Billy's Bookshelf

### Inspiration
At first, I was trying to thik of something that could help showcase the amount of work that I have put in through my time at Pitt, something that would should progress through the semesters. I felt the best theme for it would be none other than a bookshelf, housing all of my classes taken on their respective shelves.

### User Experience

I have arranged the shelves to follow all of my semesters at Pitt, with some of them being available to dig deeper. By clicking on an available class, it will open up into what that class had taught me and my work achieved. I believe this will be a way for users to see my development, and see how everything ties together.
